# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Example: http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1305, just temper with it and change the user_id

1. Encoded IDs - if sometimes look like encoding, decode it and change what you want.

2. Hashed IDs - the same as above, use https://crackstation.net/

3. Unpredictable IDs - if you cannot se the Ids, create a second account and check if you can see other users' content with the other account.

4. Where are they located? - JS, maybe request. You can also find some unreferenced parameters used in development.
