# Vulnerabilities
No direct definition, something among the lines of „weakness or flaw in the design, implementation or behaviours of a system or application”.

## Types
Main five categories:
1. Operating system
2. (Mis)Configuration-based
3. Weak or Default Credentials
4. Application Logic
5. and the most vulnerable one - Human-Factor

## Scoring vulnerabilities
Many different systems, like [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator), but it's pretty much **risk x severity**.

## Vulnerability/Exploit Databases, Tools
- NVD (National Vulnerability Database) - here are they assigned as `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`.
- [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) - just put desired software with its version and if you're in luck, you'll find something.
- [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/) - same as above
- [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) - automated vulnerability scanner
- Github - many researchers also post their exploits on github
- Searchsploit - an offline command-line tool for exploits:

```sh
# Find vulnerability id
$ searchsploit SOFT_VERSION

# Get the actual exploit
$ searchsploit -m EXPLOIT_ID
```
