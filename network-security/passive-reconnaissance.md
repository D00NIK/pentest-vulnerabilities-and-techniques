## WHOIS
A useful protocol about a domain name, but it is unfortunately almost always redacted for privacy. An example:

```sh
$ whois google.com
```

They're getting DNS records from domains, their usage if very similar

### Nslookup (Name-server lookup)

```sh
# nslookup -type=(record type) doma.in (DNS server)
$ nslookup -type=A google.com 1.1.1.1
```

### Dig (Domain Information Groper)

```sh
# dig @(DNS server) doma.in (record type)
$ dig @1.1.1.1 google.com AAAA
