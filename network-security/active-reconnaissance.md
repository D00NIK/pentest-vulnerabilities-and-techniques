# Active Reconnaissance
The same as passive, but actually messing with target's systems yourself.

## Web Browser
Every company has one, try messing with that first. By default, we are connecting to TCP ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). Browsers gives us dev tools to mess with websites, here all your web hacking knowledge shines.

Also, this is active reconnaissance because we are connecting to our target; however, our movement is pretty much undistinguishable (when just exploring) to other customers.

## Ping
This command-line tool uses ICMP, whose primary use is for error messages. In this particular example, its job is to indicate if a specific host is up and if so, how much delay is there.

If a device is on and connected to a network, it should be able to ping us back. But if not, **there is a faulty network device on the path**, or just simply **it is being blocked by a firewall** (which is the case on Windows by default).

## Traceroute
Another command utility, by using UDP with different TTL values, it tries to trace what devices are on our path to the host. Not all routers return a reply.

## Telnet
Deprecated remote shell, uses port 23.

We are not interested in it itself, but it's client. It uses TCP, so we can try to connect to ports and get data from them. For example, HTTP:

```sh
# telnet MACHINE_IP PORT
$ telnet tryhackme.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: telnet
```

We connect to the port 80 and try to get a website root `/` using `HTTP/1.1`. We also have to provide a host.

## Netcat
A command line tool working as a client and a server. Supports both TCP and UDP. We can use it like `telnet`:

```sh
$ nc tryhackme.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: netcat
```

Moreover, we can set up a server (e.g. for reverse shell):

```sh
$ nc -vnlp 3636
```
