# Cross-site scripting (XSS)
Just injecting javascript to the HTML tree. Using unsafe payloads, JavaScript is saved into the database and triggers on load. Also links with parameters including JS sent to victims.

1. Types:
- Reflected XSS - „when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation”. Example:<br>
`https://website.thm/?error=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. The website backend returns a website with an error containing malicious JS

- Stored XSS - Any type of input sent and saved in the DB e.g. comments, profiles info, anything. Often it is validated only on the frontend, so one may find useful looking at the HTTP requets and sending their own.

- DOM Based XSS - Very similar to a Reflected XSS, but the code isn't send or stored in the backend or DB. This is for example when a parameters in a link are used to render something on a page. An example from OWASP:

```HTML
Select your language:

<select><script>

document.write("<OPTION value=1>"+decodeURIComponent(document.location.href.substring(document.location.href.indexOf("default=")+8))+"</OPTION>");

document.write("<OPTION value=2>English</OPTION>");

</script></select>
```

It can be exploited with:<br>
`http://www.some.site/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`

- Blind XSS - similar to a stored XSS, but you can't see your payload working or be able to test it yourself. E.g. adding some juicy JS to the ticket description. It might work if you visit it's description, but you can't be sure if the admin panel views it in the same way.
