# Command Injection
Executing commands on a vulnerable app's OS, using the same privileges that the app has.

Sometimes an app is making system calls with the data provided in some way by the user, so sometimes the **shell operators** (`;`, `&` and `&&`) can be utilized for combining system commands and with that exploiting them.

It can be divided into two categories:
- Blind
- Verbose

## Blind Command Injection
We don't get exact results of the commands we send, so we can figure if they work out by e.g. ping or sleep.

## Verbose Command Injection
As the name suggests, we get the info, so it's much easier.

## Useful commands
|Linux|Windows|
|---|---|
|whoami|whoami|
|ls|dir|
|ping|ping|
|sleep|timeout|
|nc (for reverse shell)||

## Remediating Command Injection
Evade using vulnerable, able to execute shell cmds, e.g. in PHP:
- exec
- passthru
- system

### Input sanitization
For example, accept only digits if you don't even expect to use letters. **Remove special characters** such as `>`, `&` and `/`.

### Bypassing Filters
Various techniques in evading, e.g. using hexadecimal representations of special characters, it'll work likewise.
