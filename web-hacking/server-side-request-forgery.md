# Server-Side Request Forgery
Basically causing webserver to make an additional or edited HTTP request.

## Where to find?
- full URL used in a parameter
- hidden field in a form
- partial URL such as just the hostname, e.g.: `https://website.thm/form?server=api`
- or only the path of the URL: `https://website.thm/form?dst=/forms/contact`

## Ways to defend:
- Deny List - all excepted apart from specified, such as localhost. Bypassing â‡¾ **use alternative localhost references** or **DNS record pointing to localhost**.
- Allow List - e.g. only allowing from specific website. If done wrong, can be manipulated with subdomain: `https://website.thm.attackers-domain.thm`
- Open Redirect - Sometimes websites' have redirection links for advertising/marketing purpose. Use them!: `https://website.thm/link?url=https://tryhackme.com`
