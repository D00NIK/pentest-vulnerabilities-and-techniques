# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Example: http://online-service.thm/profile?user_id=1305, just temper with it and change the user_id

## Encoded IDs
if something is encoded, decode it and change what you want.

## Hashed IDs
the same as above, use https://crackstation.net/

## Unpredictable IDs
if you cannot see the Ids, create a second account and check if you can see other users' content with the other account.

## Where are they located?
JS, maybe request. You can also find some unreferenced parameters used in development.
